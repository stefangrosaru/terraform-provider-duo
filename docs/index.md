# Duo Provider

The Duo provider is used to interact with Duo resources.

The provider allows you to manage your Duo resources easily. It needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "duo" {}
```

It is recommended to leave the provider field blank and export credentials to the environment.

```bash
export DUO_API_HOSTNAME=api-XXXXXXXX.duosecurity.com
export DUO_INTEGRATION_KEY=DIXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export DUO_SECRET_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
```
